# Minecraft Server on Amazon ECS

This project consists of two CloudFormation stacks that can
be deployed via [`stk`](https://github.com/jwoffindin/stk).

* minecraft-server - deploys a spot-instance minecraft server
* discord-bot  - partially-completed Discord Bot to manage the server - so my son can (or ban ðŸ¤”) his friends.

## Minecraft server

1. Create config file as below
1. Create VPC stack `cfn deploy vpc dev`
1. Spin up minecraft `cfn deploy minecraft dev`.
1. You can stop it any time with `cfn deploy minecraft dev --var running=false`


```

## Discord bot

Not in a working state, although it does integrate and serve requests -
just doesn't do anything with them.

Configuration:

```
---
includes:
  - common

refs:
  lambda_layers:
  minecraft_server:

vars:
  application: "Minecraft Bot"
  python_lambda_layer_arn: "{{ refs.lambda_layers.PythonLayerArn }}"
  api_endpoint: "discord.{{ hosted_zone }}"
  frontend_sg: "{{ refs.minecraft_server.IngressSecurityGroupId }}"
  autoscaling_group: "{{ refs.minecraft_server.AutoscalingGroupId }}"
  ecs_service_id: "{{ refs.minecraft_server.EcsServiceId }}"

environments:
  dev:
    vars:
      discord_public_key: PUBLIC_KEY
      discord_app_id: APP_ID

      discord_bot_token: BOT_TOKEN
```

The deploy with
